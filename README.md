## Description

My applicationâ€™s folder structure follows Model-View-Controller structure.  It uses express-handlebars package to use Handlebars.js for your Views, use the MySQL2 and Sequelize packages to connect to a MySQL database for your Models, and created an Express.js API for your Controllers. Also uses dotenv package to use environment variables, the bcrypt package to hash passwords, and the express-session and connect-session-sequelize packages to add authentication.
